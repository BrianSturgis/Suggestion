# _Week 2 Friday project "suggestion"_

#### _Programing language , 10/23/2020_

#### By _**Brian Sturgis**_

## Detailed Description

_Programming Language Suggester webpage (using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery) that asks future students a series of questions about themselves and provides a language suggestion based on their answers. You can ask questions about the languages themselves, the kinds of environments where these languages are used, or anything else you find relevant. Note that you are not required to research the languages extensively and you can even choose silly or irrelevant questions to determine which language would be best - for instance, people that like singing in the rain may prefer Ruby while chihuahua lovers might prefer C#._
